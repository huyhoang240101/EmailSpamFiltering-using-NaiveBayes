# EmailSpamFiltering-using-NaiveBayes
1. Problem description <br>
Electronic mail (email or e-mail) is a method of exchanging messages ("mail") between people using electronic devices and an email "spam" is an unsolicited bulk email. The problem is to classify emails as “spam” or “non-spam”. <br>
•	Input: Representation of the content of an email (e.g., a vector of keyword weights). <br>
•	Output: An assigned label of either “spam” or “normal”.
2. Machine Learning Algorithm <br>
Naive Bayes is a statistical classification technique based on Bayes Theorem. It is one of the simplest supervised learning algorithms. Naive Bayes classifier is the fast, accurate and reliable algorithm. Naive Bayes classifiers have high accuracy and speed on large datasets.
